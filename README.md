# tlasniperv4
## if you want an auction sniper rn don't use this and just use [cofl](https://sky.coflnet.com/refed?refId=VQ28Jo) lmao. wouldn't recommend tlasniper *right now*
that's because tlasniperv4 is still in development so it isn't really that good at anything at all. 

vision is basically to make a sniper which is unreasonably fast but is still *relatively* accurate in terms of pricing. 

`| 06:20:31 | INFO | 129 new items have been scanned, with a total time taken of 0:00:00.008757.`<br>`| 06:20:34 | INFO | Fetching Complete. 54079 items parsed, with a total time taken of 0:00:02.856064.` <br>(its going to get much slower as i add more things)

the source code is just public in case people want to see what's going on and how it works etc. sorry for spaghetti code. it makes sense in my head

tlasniper snipes things its pretty cool trust. this is version 4. (don't ask about version 3) sends flips to a discord server channel.

there are no plans to create a mod anytime soon, but you never know

## features
* well there aren't really any right now
* im not sure why i'm writing a markdown thing
* takes into account average lbin (in a weird way)
* takes into account (2nd) lowest bin (tells you to list at basically lowestbin)
* takes into account the volume of item sales in order to avoid things that don't sell
* profit calculations with hypixel's latest anti inflation update
* websocket if anybody wants to make a mod which uses it. dibs not me.
* a complete dependency on python dictionaries and their speed.

## upcoming features
* actual calculations. take into account more than lbin. like stars and enchantments
* pets first because they seem the easiest and i can base everything off it
* list of users who have been selling many items recently (so you can stalk their ah)

## [join the discord server](https://discord.gg/rZ6GxpqRgr)
flips are sent to the discord. you can see them there. so join maybe. not a oauth rat.
